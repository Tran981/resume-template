# Steen Resume
This is a simple one-page resume template/framework written in LaTeX geared towards undergraduate cs students. Meant to easily compile and update the resume as the repository changes over time, it can be used in conjunction with the template already loaded or with others.

# Inspiration
To fully utilize git's functionality as a living resume hosting service, this template is meant to be used with a simple resume written in some form of tex such as the [**Cline-Resume**](https://github.com/Rjected/Cline-Resume) or the [**Deedy-Resume**](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume), and allow the user to easy automation of building and updating his/her resume in a format to display on a website or to propigate to other platforms. 

The preloaded resume template is of my own design noticing how the resume templates above might not address all the concerns that a computer science student may have, such as full keyword association as many companies scrape resumes for keywords before consideration and the ability to easily update different portions of a resume without looking through hundred of lines of tex. 

More importantly, I hope that the resume accomplishes its design goals of being clean, simple, and able to draw attention to details.

# To build
Requires: A XÆŽTEX and GNU Make

Commands:

`make`

In the future I hope to add support for other tex distributions and add it to the makefile

# Example
TBA
